# AncestryPainter

AncestryPainter is a graphing tool developed by Qidi Feng and Dongsheng Lu in 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2018.05.002). It can visualize the ancestry composition and genetic difference, and merge ancestry proportion matrix output by ancestry inference tools like ADMIXTURE.

Since Aug, 2021, a new version of AncestryPainter has been developed by Shuanghui Chen and her  collaborators. Now this project is still ongoing.
